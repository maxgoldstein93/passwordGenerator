Introduction: Password Generator

This project is a random password generator. Based off of user inputs a password is generated for the user based off of their criteria. I developed this web application as a homework assignment because we are learning how to use conditional statements and for loops.  Through the implementation of for loops and conditional statements plus the use of alerts, prompts and confirms a user can generate a random password between 8-128 characters long. This helps users if they need to create a random password that is strong.

To install and use this web application the user will go to github and make a repo of my project or follow the link provided. Once on the web page the user will be prompted to choose how many characters they want the password to be. What type of characters, numbers, special characters, lowercase and uppercase letters. Once all user inputs are in a loop will generate a password for the user.

My project uses strings of characters instead of arrays which I think is more efficient . I have many takeaways from this project. First, there are many ways using javascript to solve a problem. That when creating variables they can be set to nothing at first,  how to use loops and conditionals and how to add strings together.
